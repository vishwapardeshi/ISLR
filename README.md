# Machine Learning Projects

My tryst with Machine Learning began with a love for Statistics from high school. During my Computer Engineering undergraduate program, I became comfortable with Machine Learning and since then I have worked on several mini-projects which are contained in this repository.

**This repository contains X mini projects in Python, R & Spark.**

## Repository Outline

The repository contains mini-projects on the following machine learning techniques:
1. [Linear Regression](https://medium.com/@pardeshi.vishwa25/linear-regression-model-for-ml-cd18a392bd8b) - Simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, non-linear transformation of predictors
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linear & Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
4. K-Nearest Neighbour
5. Polynomial Regression
6. Splines
7. GAM
8. Decision Trees - Regression, Classification, Bagging, Boosting
9. Support Vector Machines 
10. Principal Component Analysis
11. K-means Clustering
12. Ensemble Models
