# Machine Learning Projects

My tryst with Machine Learning began with a love for Statistics from high school. During my Computer Engineering undergraduate program, I became comfortable with Machine Learning and since then I have worked on several mini-projects which are contained in this repository.

**This repository contains X mini projects in Python & R.**

## Repository Outline

The repository contains mini-projects on the following machine learning techniques:
1. [Linear Regression](https://medium.com/p/cd18a392bd8b/edit) - Simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, non-linear transformation of predictors
2. Logistic Regression
3. Linear Discriminant Analysis
4. Quadratic Discriminant Analysis
5. K-Nearest Neighbour
6. Polynomial Regression
7. Splines
8. GAM
9. Decision Trees - Regression, Classification, Bagging, Boosting
10. Support Vector Machines 
11. Principal Component Analysis
12. K-means Clustering
13. Ensemble Models
