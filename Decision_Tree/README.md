# Decision Tree 

Decision Trees follow human-decision making process and are highly interpretable. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional decision tree, various variants such as Bagged, Boosted, Random Forest are explored. 

## Folder Outline

The folder contains mini-projects which utilize Decision Tree algorithms. The following are the themes of the mini-projects
1. Decision Tree (Gini Impurity & Entropy) from Scratch using Python.
2. Exploring & predicting house price in Boston using Decision Tree and its variants.

## Datasets
1. Boston Housing Dataset

## Concepts Covered
The following are implemented:

1. Splitting criteria - gini impurity & entropy
2. Building & visualizing 2-level decision tree from scratch using python
3. Baseline model for classification
4. Classification Decision Tree
5. Bagged Tree using sklearn
6. Random Forest Classifier using sklearn

## Tech used
