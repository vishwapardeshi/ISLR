# Decision Tree 

Decision Trees follow human-decision making process and are highly interpretable. To overcome the shortcomings of traditional decision tree, various variants such as Bagged, Boosted, Random Forest are explored. 

## Folder Outline

The folder contains mini-projects which utilize Decision Tree algorithms. The following are the themes of the mini-projects
1. Decision Tree (Gini Impurity & Entropy) from Scratch using Python.
2. Exploring & predicting house price in Boston using Decision Tree and its variants.
